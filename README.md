# Animate and Semantic Role Label Classification
In this project we present a novel approach towards animate and semantic role label classification by combining state of the art neural network approaches 
with semantic information of the data. Semantic role label classification is a neural linguistics programming task that consists of the automatic assignment of semantic roles to each argument of the main predicate in a sentence. Animacy is the property for a referent of a noun to be an agent based on how sentient or alive the referent is.

# Motivation
The main drive behind this project is, that we can make use of the information of animacy in semantic role labeling and vice versa to subsequently boost the accuracy peformance of both.
