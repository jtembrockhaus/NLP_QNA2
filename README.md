# Animate and Semantic Role Label Classification
In this project we present a novel approach towards animate and semantic role label classification by combining state of the art neural network approaches 
with semantic information of the data. Semantic role label classification is a neural linguistics programming task that consists of the automatic assignment of semantic roles to each argument of the main predicate in a sentence. Animacy is the property for a referent of a noun to be an agent based on how sentient or alive the referent is.
